        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>5 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>12 oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
            Toss together butternut squash, 2 teaspoons of the 
            oil, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of 
            the pepper. Arrange in a single layer on a rimmed 
            baking sheet.</p>
            
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until softened and lightly 
            browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside.
        </p>

        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet 
            over medium-high heat. Add onion and 1/4 teaspoon of the 
            salt, and cook, stirring often, until softened and 
            translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add spinach, and cook, 
            stirring often, until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. 
            Remove from heat, and set aside.
        </p>

        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Combine shredded provolone and mozzarella in a bowl. 
            Stir together ricotta, parsley, eggs, 1 1/2 cups 
            of the shredded cheese mixture, and remaining 3/4 
            teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a large bowl.
        </p>

        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Lightly coat a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking 
            spray. Spread 1 cup of the marinara on the bottom. 
            Arrange 4 noodles side by side over sauce; spread 
            half of ricotta mixture over noodles. Spread roasted 
            squash evenly over ricotta mixture; top with 1 1/2 
            cups marinara.
        </p>
        <p>
            Top with 4 more noodles and remaining 
            ricotta mixture. Spread spinach mixture evenly over 
            ricotta mixture; top with 1 1/2 cups marinara. 
            Top with remaining 4 noodles and 1 cup marinara. 
            Sprinkle with Parmesan and remaining shredded cheese 
            mixture. Cover with aluminum foil. 
        </p>

        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 35 minutes. 
            Uncover; bake until golden and bubbly, about 20 minutes more. 
            Let stand 10 minutes before cutting into 10 slices.
